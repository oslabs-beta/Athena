## Intro


AthenaJS is a component visualizer workshop that allows developers to quickly develop and edit their React 
components without codebase integration.  

    Easy to use: AthenaJS is a standalone electron application that allows developers to import their
    own React components or create components from scratch within the application's code editor. 
    Dynamic: Developers can mock fetch request/data, edit the state, props and functions of their components wihtin the application's code editor. They will be able to see those changes reflected within the component visualizer.
